1. Open the .csv file with microsoft excel 
2. Add a new column
3. Give this column the column title 'Goal'
4. Locate the column with the title 'result' and note the cell of the first entry after the title (in this example, I will say C2)
5. Select the 2nd cell in the new column you have created and enter this formula in the cell : =IF(C2="Goal", 1, 0) and press enter, you should have a 1 or 0 displayed in this cell
6. Hover your mouse over the small square in the lower-right corner of the cell that now displays 1 or 0 until it turns into a black crosshair
7. Click and drag down to apply the formula for all the rows in your new column that correspond to the data in the 'result column'
8. Your new column should now display 0 and 1 values (1 for Goal and 0 for everything else)
